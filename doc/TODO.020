description of the patch.)

Backport for 0.2.0:
  o r19291, r19292, r19295, r19296: Dir mirrors tell relays their actual
    IP address, not just the address listed in the directory currently.

Backport for 0.2.0 once better tested:
  - r17208,r17209,r7211,r17212,r17214: Avoid gotterdammerung when an
    authority has an expired certificate.
  - r17886: Don't remove routerinfos as unlisted unless we have a
    consensus.
  - r17924: Close streams when an exit hands us a local IP.
  - r18667: Drop BEGIN cells from wrong circuit hop.
  - r18743: Fix alignment-related crash on Sparc.
  - r18809: Build correctly from outside the main source tree.

Backport for 0.2.0, maybe:
  d r17945: bridges always fail dirport reachability tests. i think
            it's cosmetic, so no need to backport.
  d r18668: Drop duplicate extend cells to same circuit ID; prevent mem leak.
  d r18210: Call crypto_global_init() with hardwareaccel flag set right in
    all cases.
