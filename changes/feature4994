  o Minor features:
    - Teach bridge-using clients to avoid 0.2.2 bridges when making
      microdescriptor-related dir requests, and only fall back to normal
      descriptors if none of their bridges can handle microdescriptors
      (as opposed to the fix in ticket 4013, which caused them to fall
      back to normal descriptors if *any* of their bridges preferred
      them). Resolves ticket 4994.
