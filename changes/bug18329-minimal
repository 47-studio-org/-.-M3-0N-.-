  o Minor features (bridge):
    - Bridges now include notice in their descriptors that they are bridges,
      and notice of their distribution status, based on their publication
      settings.  Implements ticket 18329.  For more fine-grained control of
      how a bridge is distributed, upgrade to 0.3.2.x or later.
