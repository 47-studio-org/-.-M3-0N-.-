  o Normal bugfixes:
     - When launching a resolve request on behalf of an AF_UNIX control
       socket, omit the address field of the new entry connection, used in
       subsequent controller events, rather than letting tor_dup_addr() set
       it to "<unknown address type>".  Fixes bug 8639.
