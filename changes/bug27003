  o Major bugfixes (event scheduler):
    - When we enable a periodic event, schedule it in the event loop
      rather than running it immediately. Previously, we would re-run
      periodic events immediately in the middle of (for example)
      changing our options, with unpredictable effects.  Fixes bug
      27003; bugfix on 0.3.4.1-alpha.
