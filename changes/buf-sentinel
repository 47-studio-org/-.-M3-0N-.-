  o Major features (security fixes):

    - Prevent a class of security bugs caused by treating the contents
      of a buffer chunk as if they were a NUL-terminated string.  At
      least one such bug seems to be present in all currently used
      versions of Tor, and would allow an attacker to remotely crash
      most Tor instances, especially those compiled with extra compiler
      hardening. With this defense in place, such bugs can't crash Tor,
      though we should still fix them as they occur. Closes ticket 20384
      (TROVE-2016-10-001).
