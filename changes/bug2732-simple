  o Minor bugfixes
    - Do not reject hidden service descriptors simply because we don't
      think we have not been assigned the HSDir flag.  Clients and
      hidden services can have a more up-to-date view of the network
      consensus, and if they think that the directory authorities
      list us a HSDir, we might actually be one.  Related to bug 2732;
      bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.
