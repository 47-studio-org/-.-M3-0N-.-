  o Major bugfixes (compression):
    - Fix crash in LZMA module, when the Sandbox is enabled, where
      liblzma would allocate more than 16 MB of memory.  We solve this
      by bumping the mprotect() limit in the Sandbox module from 16 MB
      to 20 MB.  Fixes bug 22751; bugfix on 0.3.1.1-alpha.
