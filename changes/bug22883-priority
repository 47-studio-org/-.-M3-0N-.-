  o Major bugfixes (relay, performance):

    - Perform circuit handshake operations at a higher priority than we use
      for consensus diff creation and compression. This should prevent
      circuits from starving when a relay or bridge receive a new consensus,
      especially on lower-powered machines. Fixes bug 22883; bugfix on
      0.3.1.1-alpha.
