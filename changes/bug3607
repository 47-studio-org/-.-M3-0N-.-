  o Minor bugfixes:

    - Write several files in text mode, on OSes that distinguish text
      mode from binary mode (namely, Windows).  These files are:
      buffer-stats, dirreq-stats, and entry-stats on relays that collect
      those statistics; client_keys and hostname files for hidden
      services that use authentication; and (in the tor-gencert utility)
      newly generated identity and signing keys.  Previously, we
      wouldn't specify text mode or binary mode, leading to an assertion
      failure.  Fixes bug 3607.  Bugfix on 0.2.1.1-alpha (when the
      DirRecordUsageByCountry option which would have triggered the
      assertion failure was added), although this assertion failure
      would have occurred in tor-gencert on Windows in 0.2.0.1-alpha.
