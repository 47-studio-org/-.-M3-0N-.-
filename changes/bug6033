  o Major bugfixes:
    - Work around a bug in OpenSSL that broke renegotiation with
      TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2.  Without this workaround, all attempts
      to speak the v2 Tor network protocol when both sides were
      using OpenSSL 1.0.1 would fail.  Fix for bug 6033, which is
      not a bug in Tor.
