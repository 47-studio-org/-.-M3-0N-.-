  o Minor bugfixes
    - Avoid a bug that would keep us from replacing a microdescriptor
      cache on Windows.  (We would try to replace the file while still
      holding it open.  That's fine on Unix, but Windows doesn't let us
      do that.)  Bugfix on 0.2.2.6-alpha; bug found by wanoskarnet.
