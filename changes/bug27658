  o Minor bugfixes (testing):
    - If a unit test running in a subprocess exits abnormally or with a
      nonzero status code, treat the test as having failed, even if
      the test reported success. Without this fix, memory leaks don't cause
      cause the tests to fail, even with LeakSanitizer. Fixes bug 27658;
      bugfix on 0.2.2.4-alpha.
