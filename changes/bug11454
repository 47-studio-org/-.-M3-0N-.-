  o Minor bugfixes (certificate handling):
    - Remove any old authority certificates that have been superseded
      for at least two days.  Previously, we would keep superseded
      certificates until they expired, if they were published close
      in time to the certificate that superseded them.
      Fixes bug 11454; bugfix on 0.2.1.8-alpha.
