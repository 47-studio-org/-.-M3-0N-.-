  o Minor bugfixes (documentation):
    - Document that the PerConnBW{Rate,Burst} options will fall back to their
      corresponding consensus parameters only if those parameters are
      set. Previously we had claimed that these values would always be
      set in the consensus. Fixes bug 25296; bugfix on 0.2.2.7-alpha.
