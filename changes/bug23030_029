  o Minor bugfixes (coverity builds):
    - Avoid Coverity build warnings related to our BUG() macro. By
      default, Coverity treats BUG() as the Linux kernel does: an
      instant abort(). We need to override that so our BUG() macro
      doesn't prevent Coverity from analyzing functions that use it.
      Fixes bug 23030; bugfix on 0.2.9.1-alpha.
