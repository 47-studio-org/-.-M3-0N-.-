  o Major bugfix (Hidden service client)
    - Revert commit 9407040c592184e05e45a3c1a00739c2dd302288 of bug #14219
      that indeed fixed an issue but introduced a major hidden service
      reachability regression detailed in bug #16381. This is a temporary
      fix since we can live with the minor issue in #14219 but the
      regression introduced is too much of a set back.

      To be clear, #14219 bug just results in some load on the network, and
      some delay for the client when visiting a hidden service that will
      ultimately fail.

      This is only a bandaid for #16381 thus it does _not_ fixes it. bugfix
      on tor-0.2.6.3-alpha~138.
