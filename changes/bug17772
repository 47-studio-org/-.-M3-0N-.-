  o Major bugfixes (guard selection):
    - Actually look at the Guard flag when selecting a new directory
      guard. When we implemented the directory guard design, we
      accidentally started treating all relays as if they have the Guard
      flag during guard selection, leading to weaker anonymity and worse
      performance. Fixes bug 17222; bugfix on 0.2.4.8-alpha. Discovered
      by Mohsen Imani.
