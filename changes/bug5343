  o Security fixes:
    - Only build circuits if we have a sufficient threshold of the total
      descriptors marked in the consensus with the "Exit" flag.  This
      mitigates an attack proposed by wanoskarnet, in which all of a
      client's bridges collude to restrict the exit nodes that the
      client knows about.  Fixes bug 5343.
