  o Major bugfixes:

    - Fix an uninitialized read that could (in some cases) lead to a remote
      crash while parsing INTRODUCE 1 cells. (This is, so far as we know,
      unrelated to the recent news.)  Fixes bug XXX; bugfix on
      0.2.4.1-alpha. Anybody running a hidden service on the experimental
      0.2.4.x branch should upgrade.
