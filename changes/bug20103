  o Major bugfixes (crash):

    - Fix a complicated crash bug that could affect Tor clients
      configured to use bridges when replacing a networkstatus consensus
      in which one of their bridges was mentioned. OpenBSD users saw
      more crashes here, but all platforms were potentially affected.
      Fixes bug 20103; bugfix on 0.2.8.2-alpha.
