  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Resolve an untriggerable issue in smartlist_string_num_isin(),
      where if the function had ever in the future been used to check
      for the presence of a too-large number, it would have given an
      incorrect result.  (Fortunately, we only used it for 16-bit
      values.)  Fixes bug 3175; bugfix on Tor 0.1.0.1-rc.
