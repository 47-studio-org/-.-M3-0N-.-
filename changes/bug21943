  o Minor bugfixes (Linux seccomp2 sandbox):
    - The getpid() system call is now permitted under the Linux seccomp2
      sandbox, to avoid crashing with versions of OpenSSL (and other
      libraries) that attempt to learn the process's PID by using the
      syscall rather than the VDSO code. Fixes bug 21943; bugfix on
      0.2.5.1-alpha.
