  * Minor bugfixes:

    - Demote the 'replay detected' log message emitted when a hidden
      service receives the same Diffie-Hellman public key in two
      different INTRODUCE2 cells to info level.  A normal Tor client
      can cause that log message during its normal operation.  Bugfix
      on 0.2.1.6-alpha; fixes part of bug 2442.
