  o Security fixes:

    - Reject CREATE and CREATE_FAST cells on outgoing OR connections
      from a bridge to a relay.  Previously, we would accept them and
      handle them normally, thereby allowing a malicious relay to
      easily distinguish bridges which connect to it from clients.
      Fixes CVE-2011-2769.  Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha, when bridges were
      implemented; found by frosty_un.
