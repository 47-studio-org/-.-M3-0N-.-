  o Major features (deprecation):
    - There's now a "DisableV2DirectoryInfo_" option that prevents us
      from serving any directory requests for v2 directory information.
      This is for us to test disabling the old deprecated V2 directory
      format, so that we can see whether doing so has any effect on
      network load. Part of a fix for bug 6783.
