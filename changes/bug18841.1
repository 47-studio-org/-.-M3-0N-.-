  o Major bugfixes (compilation):
    - Correctly detect compiler flags on systems where _FORTIFY_SOURCE
      is predefined. Previously, our use of -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE would
      cause a compiler warning, thereby making other checks fail.
      Fixes one case of bug 18841; bugfix on 0.2.3.17-beta. Patch from
      "trudokal".
