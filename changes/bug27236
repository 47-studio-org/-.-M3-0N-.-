  o Minor bugfixes (testing, bootstrap):
    - When calculating bootstrap progress, check exit policies and the exit
      flag. Previously, Tor would only check the exit flag, which caused
      race conditions in small and fast networks like chutney.
      Fixes bug 27236; bugfix on 0.2.6.3-alpha.
