  o Minor bugfixes (consensus diff):
    - test_consdiff_base64cmp would fail on OS X because while OS X
      follows the standard of (less than zero/zero/greater than zero),
      it doesn't follow the convention of (-1/0/+1). Make the test
      comply with the standard. Fixes bug 22870; bugfix on 0.3.1.1-alpha.
