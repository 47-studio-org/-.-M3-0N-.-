  o Major bugfixes (security):
    - Fix a denial of service bug where an attacker could use a malformed
      directory object to cause a Tor instance to pause while OpenSSL would
      try to read a passphrase from the terminal. (If the terminal was not
      available, tor would continue running.)  Fixes bug 24246; bugfix on
      every version of Tor.  Also tracked as TROVE-2017-011 and
      CVE-2017-8821.  Found by OSS-Fuzz as testcase 6360145429790720.
