  o Security fixes:

    - Don't send TLS certificate chains on outgoing OR connections
      from clients and bridges.  Previously, each client or bridge
      would use a single cert chain for all outgoing OR connections
      for up to 24 hours, which allowed any relay connected to by a
      client or bridge to determine which entry guards it is using.
      This is a potential user-tracing bug for *all* users; everyone
      who uses Tor's client or hidden service functionality should
      upgrade.  Fixes CVE-2011-2768.  Bugfix on FIXME; found by
      frosty_un.

    - Don't use any OR connection on which we have received a
      CREATE_FAST cell to satisfy an EXTEND request.  Previously, we
      would not consider whether a connection appears to be from a
      client or bridge when deciding whether to use that connection to
      satisfy an EXTEND request.  Mitigates CVE-2011-2768, by
      preventing an attacker from determining whether an unpatched
      client is connected to a patched relay.  Bugfix on FIXME; found
      by frosty_un.
