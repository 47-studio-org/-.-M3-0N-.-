  o Minor bugfixes (pluggable transports):
    - Initialize the extended OR Port authentication cookie before launching
      pluggable transports. This prevents a race condition that occured when
      server-side pluggable transports would cache the authentication cookie
      before it has been (re)generated. Fixes bug 15240; bugfix on
      0.2.5.1-alpha.
