  o Major bugfixes (bridges):

    - When the same bridge is configured multiple times at different
      address:port combinations (but with the same identity), treat
      those bridge instances as separate guards. This allows clients to
      configure the same bridge with multiple pluggable transports, once
      again. Fixes bug 21027; bugfix on 0.3.0.1-alpha.
