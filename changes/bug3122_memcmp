  o Security fixes
    - Replace all potentially sensitive memory comparison operations
      with versions whose runtime does not depend on the data being
      compared. This will help resist a class of attacks where an
      adversary can use variations in timing information to learn
      sensitive data.  Fix for one case of bug 3122.  (Safe memcmp
      implementation by Robert Ransom based partially on code by DJB.)
