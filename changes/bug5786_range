  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Make our number-parsing functions always treat too-large values
      as an error, even when those values exceed the width of the
      underlying type. Previously, if the caller provided these
      functions with minima or maxima set to the extreme values of the
      underlying integer type, these functions would return those
      values on overflow rather than treating overflow as an error.
      Fix for part of bug 5786; bugfix on Tor 0.0.9.
