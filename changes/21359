  o Minor features (portability, compilationc)
    - Support building with recent LibreSSL code that uses opaque
      structures. Closes ticket 21359.
    - Autoconf now check to determine if OpenSSL
      structures are opaque, instead of explicitly checking for
      OpenSSL version numbers. 
      Part of ticket 21359.
