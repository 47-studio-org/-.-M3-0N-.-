  o Minor bugfixes (test networks, exponential backoff):
    - When using exponential backoff in test networks, use a lower exponent,
      so the delays do not vary as much. This helps test networks bootstrap
      consistently. Fixes bug 20597; bugfix on 20499; not in any released
      version of tor.
