  o Minor bugfixes (testing, openssl compatibility):
    - Our "tortls/cert_matches_key" unit test no longer relies on OpenSSL
      internals.  Previously, it relied on unsupported OpenSSL behavior in
      a way that caused it to crash with OpenSSL 1.0.2p. Fixes bug 27226;
      bugfix on 0.2.5.1-alpha.
