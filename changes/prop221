  o Minor features:
    - Stop sending the CREATE_FAST cells by default; instead, use a
      parameter in the consensus to decide whether to use
      CREATE_FAST. This can improve security on connections where
      Tor's circuit handshake is stronger than the available TLS
      connection security levels. Implements proposal 221.
