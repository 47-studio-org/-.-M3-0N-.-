  o Minor bugfixes (robustness, error handling):
    - Improve our handling of the cases where OpenSSL encounters a
      memory error while encoding keys and certificates. We haven't
      observed these happening in the wild, but if they do happen,
      we now detect and respond better. Fixes bug 19418; bugfix
      on all versions of Tor. Reported by Guido Vranken.
