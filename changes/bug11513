  o Major bugfixes:
    - Generate the server's preference list for ciphersuites
      automatically based on uniform criteria, and considering all
      OpenSSL ciphersuites with acceptable strength and forward
      secrecy. (The sort order is: prefer AES to 3DES; break ties by
      preferring ECDHE to DHE; break ties by preferring GCM to CBC;
      break ties by preferring SHA384 to SHA256 to SHA1; and finally,
      break ties by preferring AES256 to AES128.) This resolves bugs
      #11513, #11492, #11498, #11499. Bugs reported by 'cypherpunks'.
      Bugfix on 0.2.4.8-alpha.
