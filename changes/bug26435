  o Major bugfixes (directory authority):
    - Fix a memory leak where directory authorities would leak a chunk
      of memory for every router descriptor every time they considered
      voting. This bug was taking down directory authorities due to
      out-of-memory issues. Fixes bug 26435; bugfix on 0.3.3.6.
