 o Build features:
   - Tor's repository now includes a Travis Continuous Integration (CI)
     configuration file (.travis.yml). This is meant to help new developers and
     contributors who fork Tor to a Github repository be better able to test
     their changes, and understand what we expect to pass. To use this new build
     feature, you must fork Tor to your Github account, then go into the
     "Integrations" menu in the repository settings for your fork and enable
     Travis, then push your changes.
