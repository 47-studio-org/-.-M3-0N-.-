  o Minor bugfixes (protocol conformance):
    - Fix a misframing issue when reading the version numbers in a
      VERSIONS cell. Previously we would recognize [00 01 00 02] as
      'version 1, version 2, and version 0x100', when it should have
      only included versions 1 and 2. Fixes bug 8059; bugfix on
      0.2.0.10-alpha. Reported pseudonymously.
