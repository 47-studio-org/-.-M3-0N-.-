  o Major bugfixes (hidden services):
    - Allow hidden service authentication to succeed again. When we
      refactored the hidden service introduction code back in 0.2.4.1-alpha,
      we didn't update the code that checks whether authentication
      information is present, causing all authentication checks to
      return "false". Fix for bug 8207; bugfix on 0.2.4.1-alpha. Found by
      Coverity; this is CID 718615.
