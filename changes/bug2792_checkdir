  o Minor features:
    - Tor now refuses to create a ControlSocket in a directory that is
      world-readable (or group-readable if ControlSocketsGroupWritable
      is 0).  This is necessary because some operating systems do not
      check the permissions on an AF_UNIX socket when programs try to
      connect to it.  Checking permissions on the directory holding
      the socket, however, seems to work everywhere.
