  o Major bugfixes:

    - Many SOCKS5 clients, when configured to offer a username/password,
      offer both username/password authentication and "no authentication".
      Tor had previously preferred no authentication, but this was
      problematic when trying to make applications get proper stream
      isolation with IsolateSOCKSAuth. Now, on any SOCKS port with
      IsolateSOCKSAuth turned on (which is the default), Tor selects
      username/password authentication if it's offered. If this confuses your
      application, you can disable it on a per-SOCKSPort basis via
      PreferSOCKSNoAuth. Fixes bug 8117; bugfix on 0.2.3.3-alpha.
