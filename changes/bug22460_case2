  o Major bugfixes (relay, link handshake):

    - When performing the v3 link handshake on a TLS connection, report that
      we have the x509 certificate that we actually used on that connection,
      even if we have changed certificates since that connection was first
      opened. Previously, we would claim to have used our most recent x509
      link certificate, which would sometimes make the link handshake fail.
      Fixes one case of bug 22460; bugfix on 0.2.3.6-alpha.
