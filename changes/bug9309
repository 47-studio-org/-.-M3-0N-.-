  o Minor bugfixes:
    - When evaluating whether to use a connection that we haven't
      decided is canonical using a recent link protocol version,
      decide that it's canonical only if it used address _does_
      match the desired address. Fixes bug 9309; bugfix on
      0.2.4.4-alpha. Reported by skruffy.
