  o Code simplification and refactoring:
    - Remove data structures which were introduced to implement the
      CellStatistics option: they are now redundant with the addition
      of timestamp to the regular packed_cell_t data structure, which
      we did in 0.2.4.18-rc in order to resolve #9093. Fixes bug
      10870.
