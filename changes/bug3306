  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Make our crypto_rand_int() function check the value of its input
      correctly. Previously, it accepted values up to UINT_MAX, but
      could return a negative number if given a value above INT_MAX+1.
      Found by George Kadianakis. Fixes bug 3306; bugfix on 0.2.2pre14.

    - Avoid a segfault when reading a malformed circuit build state
      with more than INT_MAX entries. Found by wanoskarnet. Bugfix on
      0.2.2.4-alpha.
