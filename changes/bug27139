  o Minor bugfixes (32-bit OSX and iOS, timing):
    - Fix an integer overflow bug in our optimized 32-bit millisecond-
      difference algorithm for 32-bit Apple platforms. Previously, it
      would overflow when calculating the difference between two times
      more than 47 days apart.  Fixes part of bug 27139; bugfix on
      0.3.4.1-alpha.
    - Improve the precision of our 32-bit millisecond difference
      algorithm for 32-bit Apple platforms. Fixes part of bug 27139;
      bugfix on 0.3.4.1-alpha.
    - Relax the tolerance on the mainloop/update_time_jumps test
      when running on 32-bit Apple platforms. Fixes part of bug 27139;
      bugfix on 0.3.4.1-alpha.
