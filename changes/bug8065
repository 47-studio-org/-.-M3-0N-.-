  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Downgrade an assertion in connection_ap_expire_beginning to
      an LD_BUG message. The fix for bug 8024 should prevent this
      message from displaying, but just in case a warn that we can
      diagnose is better than more assert crashes. Fix for bug 8065;
      bugfix on 0.2.4.8-alpha.
