  o Major bugfixes (download scheduling):
    - When using an exponential backoff schedule, do not give up on
      dowloading just because we have failed a bunch of times.  Since
      each delay is longer than the last, retrying indefinitely won't
      hurt. Fixes bug 20536; bugfix on 0.2.9.1-alpha.
