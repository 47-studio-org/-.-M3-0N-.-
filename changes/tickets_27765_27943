  o Minor bugfixes (CI, appveyor):
    - Only install the necessary mingw packages during our appveyor
      builds. This change makes the build a little faster, and prevents a
      conflict with a preinstalled mingw openssl that appveyor now ships.
      Fixes bugs 27943 and 27765; bugfix on 0.3.4.2-alpha.
