  o Minor bugfixes:
    - If the guard we choose first doesn't answer, we would try the
      second guard, but once we connected to the second guard we would
      abandon it and retry the first one, slowing down bootstrapping.
      The fix is to treat all our initially chosen guards as acceptable
      to use. Fixes bug 9946; bugfix on 0.1.1.11-alpha.

  o Major bugfixes:
    - Stop trying to fetch all our directory information from our first
      guard. Discovered while fixing bug 9946; bugfix on 0.2.4.8-alpha.
