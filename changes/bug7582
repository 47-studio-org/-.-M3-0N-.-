  o Major bugfixes:

    - When an exit node tells us that it is rejecting because of its
      exit policy a stream we expected it to accept (because of its exit
      policy), do not mark the node as useless for exiting if our
      expectation was only based on an exit policy summary.  Instead,
      mark the circuit as unsuitable for that particular address. Fixes
      part of bug 7582; bugfix on 0.2.3.2-alpha.
