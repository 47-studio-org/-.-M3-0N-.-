  o Minor bugfix (Exit node DNS retries):
    - Re-attempt timed-out DNS queries 3 times before failure, since our
      timeout is 5 seconds for them, but clients wait 10-15. Also allow
      slightly more timeouts per resolver before giving up on it in the
      case where an exit has multiple resolvers configured. Fixes bug 21394;
      bugfix on 0.3.1.9.
