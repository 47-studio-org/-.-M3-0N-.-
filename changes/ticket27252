  o Minor features (continuous integration):
    - Skip gcc on OSX in Travis CI, it's rarely used.
      Skip a duplicate hardening-off build in Travis on Tor 0.2.9.
      Skip gcc on Linux with default settings, because all the non-default
      builds use gcc on Linux.
      Implements ticket 27252.
