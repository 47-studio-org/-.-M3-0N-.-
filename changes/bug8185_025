  o Minor bugfixes (logging, relay shutdown, annoyance):
    - When a circuit is marked for close, do not attempt to package any cells
      for channels on that circuit. Previously, we would detect this
      condition lower in the call stack, when we noticed that the circuit had
      no attached channel, and log an annoying message. Fixes bug 8185;
      bugfix on 0.2.5.4-alpha.
