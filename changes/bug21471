  o Major bugfixes (hidden service directory v3):
    - When a descriptor lookup was done and it was not found in the directory
      cache, it would crash on a NULL pointer instead of returning the 404
      code back to the client like it was suppose to. Fixes bug 21471.;
      bugfixes on tor-0.3.0.1-alpha.
