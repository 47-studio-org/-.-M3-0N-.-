  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Avoid an off-by-one error when checking buffer boundaries when
      formatting the exit status of a pluggable transport helper.
      This is probably not an exploitable bug, but better safe than
      sorry. Fixes bug 9928; bugfix on 0.2.3.18-rc. Bug found by
      Pedro Ribeiro.
