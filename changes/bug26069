  o Minor bugfixes (hidden service v3):
    - When parsing the descriptor signature, look for the token plus an extra
      white-space at the end. This is more correct but also will allow us to
      support new fields that might start with "signature". Fixes bug 26069;
      bugfix on 0.3.0.1-alpha.
