  o Major bugfixes (parsing, security):

    - Fix a bug in parsing that could cause clients to read a single
      byte past the end of an allocated region. This bug could be
      used to cause hardened clients (built with
      --enable-expensive-hardening) to crash if they tried to visit
      a hostile hidden service.  Non-hardened clients are only
      affected depending on the details of their platform's memory
      allocator. Fixes bug 21018; bugfix on 0.2.0.8-alpha. Found by
      using libFuzzer. Also tracked as TROVE-2016-12-002 and as
      CVE-2016-1254.
