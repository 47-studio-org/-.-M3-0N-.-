  o Minor features:
    - Servers now trust themselves to have a better view than clients of
      which TLS ciphersuites to choose. (Thanks to #11513, the server
      list is now well-considered, whereas the client list has been
      chosen mainly for anti-fingerprinting purposes.) Resolves ticket
      11528.
