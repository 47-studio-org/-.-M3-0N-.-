  o Removed files:
    - The tor-tsocks.conf is no longer distributed or installed. We
      recommend that tsocks users use torsocks instead. Resolves
      ticket 8290.

  o Documentation fixes:
    - The torify manpage no longer refers to tsocks; torify hasn't
      supported tsocks since 0.2.3.14-alpha.
    - The manpages no longer reference tsocks.
