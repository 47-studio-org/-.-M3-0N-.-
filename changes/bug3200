  o Minor bugfixes:
    - When a client starts or stops using bridges, never use a circuit
      that was built before the configuration change. This behavior could
      put at risk a user who uses bridges to ensure that her traffic
      only goes to the chosen addresses. Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes
      bug 3200.
