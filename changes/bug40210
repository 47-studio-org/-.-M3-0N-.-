  o Minor features (crypto):
    - Fix undefined behavior on our Keccak library. The bug only appears on
      platforms with 32-byte CPU cache lines (e.g. armv5tel) and would result
      in wrong digests. Fixes bug 40210; bugfix on 0.2.8.1-alpha. Thanks to
      Bernhard Ãœbelacker, Arnd Bergmann and weasel for diagnosing this.
