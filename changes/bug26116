  o Minor bugfixes (compatibility, openssl):
    - Work around a change in OpenSSL 1.1.1 where
      return values that would previously indicate "no password" now
      indicate an empty password. Without this workaround, Tor instances
      running with OpenSSL 1.1.1 would accept descriptors that other Tor
      instances would reject. Fixes bug 26116; bugfix on 0.2.5.16.
