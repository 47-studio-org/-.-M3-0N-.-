  o Security fixes:
    - Bridge relays now do their directory fetches inside Tor TLS
      connections, like all the other clients do, rather than connecting
      directly to the DirPort like public relays do. Removes another
      avenue for enumerating bridges. Fixes part of bug 4115; bugfix
      on 0.2.0.35.
