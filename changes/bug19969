  o Major bugfixes (client performance);
    - Clients now respond to new application stream requests when
      they arrive, rather than waiting up to one second before starting
      to handle them. Fixes part of bug 19969; bugfix on 0.2.8.1-alpha.

  o Major bugfixes (clients on flaky network connections);
    - When Tor leaves standby because of a new application request, open
      circuits as needed to serve that request. Previously, we would
      potentially wait a very long time. Fixes part of bug 19969; bugfix
      on 0.2.8.1-alpha.
