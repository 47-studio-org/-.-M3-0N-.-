  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Correct the man page to explain that HashedControlPassword and
      CookieAuthentication can both be set, in which case either method
      is sufficient to authenticate to Tor. Bugfix on 0.2.0.7-alpha,
      when we decided to allow these config options to both be set. Issue
      raised by bug 3898.
