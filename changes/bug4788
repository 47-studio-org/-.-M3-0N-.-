  o Minor features (directory server):
    - Directory servers now reject versions of Tor older than 0.2.1.30,
      and Tor versions between 0.2.2.1-alpha and 0.2.2.20-alpha
      (inclusive). These versions accounted for only a small fraction of
      the Tor network, and have numerous known security issues. Resolves
      issue #4788.
