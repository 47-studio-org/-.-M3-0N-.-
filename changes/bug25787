  o Minor bugfixes (testing):
    - Instead of trying to  read the geoip configuration files from within the
      unit tests, instead create our own ersatz files with just enough
      geoip data in the format we expect. Trying to read from the source
      directory created problems on Windows with mingw, where the
      build system's paths are not the same as the platform's paths.
      Fixes bug 25787; bugfix on 0.3.4.1-alpha.
