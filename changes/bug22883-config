  o Minor features (directory cache, consensus diff):
    - Add a new MaxConsensusAgeForDiffs option to allow directory cache
      operators with low-resource environments to adjust the number of
      consensuses they'll store and generate diffs from. Most cache operators
      should leave it unchanged. Helps to work around bug 22883.
