  o Minor bugfixes (client):
    - When using a listed relay as a bridge, and also using
      microdescriptors, and considering that relay as a non-bridge in
      a circuit, consider its microdescriptor as a valid source of information
      about that relay. Fixes bug 25691; bugfix on 0.3.3.4-alpha.
