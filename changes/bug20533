  o Minor bugfixes (consensus downloads):
    - If a consensus expires while we are waiting for certificates to download,
      stop waiting for certificates.
    - If we stop waiting for certificates less than a minute after we started
      downloading them, do not consider the certificate download failure a
      separate failure.
      Fixes bug 20533; bugfix on commit e0204f21 in 0.2.0.9-alpha.
