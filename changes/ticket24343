  o Minor bugfixes (man page, SocksPort):
    - Remove dead code about the old "SocksSockets" option. To do so, the
      SocksSocketsGroupWritable option has been renamed to
      UnixSockssGroupWritable which does the same exact thing. The old option
      is still usable but will warn that it is deprecated. Fixes bug 24343;
      bugfix on 0.2.6.3.
