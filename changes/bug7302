  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Don't log inappropriate heartbeat messages when hibernating: a
      hibernating node is _expected_ to drop out of the consensus,
      decide it isn't bootstrapped, and so forth.  Fixes part of bug
      7302; bugfix on 0.2.3.1-alpha.

    - Don't complain about bootstrapping problems while hibernating.
      These complaints reflect a general code problems, but not one
      with any problematic effects. (No connections are actually
      opened.) Fixes part of bug 7302; bugfix on 0.2.3.2-alpha.
