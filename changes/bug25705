  o Minor bugfixes (circuit path selection):
    - Don't count path selection failures as circuit build failures. This
      should eliminate cases where Tor blames its guard or the network
      for situations like insufficient microdescriptors and/or overly
      restrictive torrc settings. Fixes bug 25705; bugfix on 0.3.3.1-alpha.
