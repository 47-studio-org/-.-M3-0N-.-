  o Minor bugfix (compilation):
    - Functions in hs_service.c was only compiled for unit test making the
      created object (.o) contain no symbols in src/or/libor.a resulting in a
      compilation warning from clang. We now expose those functions for the
      unit tests. This will be changed in 0.3.2 release. Fixes bug 21825.;
      bugfix on tor-0.3.0.1-alpha.
