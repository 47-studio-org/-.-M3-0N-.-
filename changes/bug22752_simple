  o Major bugfixes (windows, directory cache):
    - On windows, do not try to delete cached consensus documents and
      diffs, until they unmapped from memory. Allow the diff storage
      directory to grow larger in order to handle files that might
      need to stay around longer.  Fixes bug 22752; bugfix on
      0.3.1.1-alpha.
