  o Minor features (performance, compatibility):
    - Update the list of TLS cipehrsuites that a client advertises
      to match those advertised by Firefox 28. This enables selection of
      (fast) GCM ciphersuites, disables some strange old ciphers, and
      disables the ECDH (not to be confused with ECDHE) ciphersuites.
      Resolves ticket 11438.
