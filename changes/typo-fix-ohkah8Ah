  * Minor bugfixes:

    - Clarify a log message specifying the characters permitted in
      HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient client names.  Previously, the log
      message said that "[A-Za-z0-9+-_]" were permitted; that could
      have given the impression that every ASCII character between "+"
      and "_" was permitted.  Now we say "[A-Za-z0-9+_-]".  Bugfix on
      0.2.1.5-alpha.
