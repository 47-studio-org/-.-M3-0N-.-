  o Minor bugfixes:
    - When we receive a RELAY_END cell with the reason DONE, or with no
      reason, before receiving a RELAY_CONNECTED cell, report the SOCKS
      status as "connection refused."  Previously we reporting these
      cases as success but then immediately closing the connection.
      Fixes bug 7902; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc. Reported by "oftc_must_
      be_destroyed."
