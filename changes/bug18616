  o Major bugfixes (directory mirrors):
    - Decide whether to advertise begindir support the same way we decide
      whether to advertise our DirPort. These decisions being out of sync
      led to surprising behavior like advertising begindir support when
      our hibernation config options made us not advertise a DirPort.
      Resolves bug 18616; bugfix on 0.2.8.1-alpha. Patch by teor.

  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Consider more config options when relays decide whether to regenerate
      their descriptor. Fixes more of bug 12538; bugfix on 0.2.8.1-alpha.
    - Resolve some edge cases where we might launch an ORPort reachability
      check even when DisableNetwork is set. Noticed while fixing bug
      18616; bugfix on 0.2.3.9-alpha.
