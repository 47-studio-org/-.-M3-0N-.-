  o Major bugfixes:
    - Apply circuit timeouts to opened hidden-service-related circuits
      based on the correct start time.  Previously, we would apply the
      circuit build timeout based on time since the circuit's
      creation; it was supposed to be applied based on time since the
      circuit entered its current state.  Bugfix on 0.0.6; fixes part
      of bug 1297.
    - Use the same circuit timeout for client-side introduction
      circuits as for other four-hop circuits.  Previously,
      client-side introduction circuits were closed after the same
      timeout as single-hop directory-fetch circuits; this was
      appropriate with the static circuit build timeout in 0.2.1.x and
      earlier, but caused many hidden service access attempts to fail
      with the adaptive CBT introduced in 0.2.2.2-alpha.  Bugfix on
      0.2.2.2-alpha; fixes another part of bug 1297.
