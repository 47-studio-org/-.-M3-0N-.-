  o Major enhancements:
    - Re-enable TLS 1.1 and 1.2 when built with OpenSSL 1.0.1e or later.
      (OpenSSL before 1.0.1 didn't have TLS 1.1 or 1.2. OpenSSL from 1.0.1
      through 1.0.1d had bugs that prevented renegotiation from working
      with TLS 1.1 or 1.2, so we disabled them to solve bug 6033.) Fix for
      issue #6055.
