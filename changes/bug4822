  o Major security workaround:
    - When building or running with any version of OpenSSL earlier
      than 0.9.8s or 1.0.0f, disable SSLv3 support. These versions had
      a bug (CVE-2011-4576) in which their block cipher padding
      included uninitialized data, potentially leaking sensitive
      information to any peer with whom they made a SSLv3
      connection. Tor does not use SSL v3 by default, but a hostile
      client or server could force an SSLv3 connection in order to
      gain information that they shouldn't have been able to get. The
      best solution here is to upgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.8s or 1.0.0f (or
      later). But when building or running with a non-upgraded
      OpenSSL, we should instead make sure that the bug can't happen
      by disabling SSLv3 entirely.
