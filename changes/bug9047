  o Minor bugfixes:
    - If for some reason we fail to write a microdescriptor while
      rebuilding the cache, do not let the annotations from that
      microdescriptor linger in the cache file, and do not let the
      microdescriptor stay recorded as present in its old location.
      Fixes bug 9047; bugfix on 0.2.2.6-alpha.
