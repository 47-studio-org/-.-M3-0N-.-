  o Minor bugfixes (configure, build):
    - Fix the --enable-static-tor switch to properly set the -static compile
      option onto the tor binary only. Fixes bug 40111; bugfix on
      0.2.3.1-alpha.
    - Path to static libevent has been fixed as well which affects the
      --enable-static-libevent to behave correctly now. The .a file is in
      .libs/ of libevent repository, not at the root.
