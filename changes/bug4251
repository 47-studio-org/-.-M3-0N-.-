  o Minor bugfixes:

    - When a hidden service turns an extra service-side introduction
      circuit into a general-purpose circuit, free the rend_data and
      intro_key fields first, so they won't be leaked if the circuit
      is cannibalized for use as another service-side introduction
      circuit.  Bugfix on 0.2.1.7-alpha; fixes bug 4251.
