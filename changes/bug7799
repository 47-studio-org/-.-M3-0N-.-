 o Minor changes (log clarification)
   - Add more detail to a log message about relaxed timeouts. Hopefully
     this additional detail will allow us to diagnose the cause of bug 7799.
 o Minor bugfixes
   - Don't attempt to relax the timeout of already opened 1-hop circuits.
     They might never timeout. This should eliminate some/all cases of
     the relaxed timeout log message.
