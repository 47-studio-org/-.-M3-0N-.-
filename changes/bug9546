  o Major bugfixes:

    - When a relay is extending a circuit to a bridge, it needs to send a
      NETINFO cell, even when the bridge hasn't sent an AUTH_CHALLENGE
      cell. Fixes bug 9546; bugfix on 0.2.3.6-alpha.

    - Bridges send AUTH_CHALLENGE cells during their handshakes; previously
      they did not, which prevented relays from successfully connecting
      to a bridge for self-test or bandwidth testing. Fixes bug 9546;
      bugfix on 0.2.3.6-alpha.
