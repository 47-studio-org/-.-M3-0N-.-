  o Minor bugfixes (compression):
    - When decompressing an object received over an anonymous directory
      connection, if we have already successfully decompressed it using an
      acceptable compression method, do not reject it for looking like an
      unacceptable compression method. Fixes part of bug 22670; bugfix on
      0.3.1.1-alpha.
