  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Revert the UseBridges option to its behavior before 0.2.2.28-beta.
      When we changed the default behavior to "use bridges if any are
      listed in the torrc", we broke a number of users who had bridges
      in their torrc files but who didn't actually want to use them.
      Partial resolution for bug 3354.
