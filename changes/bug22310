  o Major bugfixes (performance, load balancing):
    - Directory authorities no longer vote in favor of the Guard flag
      for relays that don't advertise directory support. Starting in Tor
      0.3.0.1-alpha, Tor clients have been avoiding using such relays in
      the Guard position, leading to increasingly broken load balancing
      for the 5%-or-so of Guards that don't advertise directory support.
      Fixes bug 22310; bugfix on 0.3.0.6.
