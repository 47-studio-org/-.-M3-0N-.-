  o Minor bugfixes (user interface):
    - Remove a warning message "Service [scrubbed] not found after
      descriptor upload". This message appears when one uses HSPOST control
      command to upload a service descriptor. Since there is only a descriptor
      and no service, showing this message is pointless and confusing.
      Fixes bug 19464; bugfix on 0.2.7.2-alpha.
