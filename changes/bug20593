  o Minor bugfixes (client directory scheduling):
    - Treat "relay too busy to answer request" as a failed request and a
      reason to back off on our retry frequency. This is safe now that
      exponential backups retry indefinitely, and avoids a bug where we would
      reset our download schedule erroneously.
      Fixes bug 20593; bugfix on 0.2.9.1-alpha.
