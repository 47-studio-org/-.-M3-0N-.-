  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Always check the return values of functions fcntl() and
      setsockopt(). We don't believe these are ever actually failing in
      practice, but better safe than sorry. Also, checking these return
      values should please some analysis tools (like Coverity). Patch
      from 'flupzor'. Fix for bug 8206; bugfix on all versions of Tor.
