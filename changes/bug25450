  o Minor bugfixes (testing):
    - Avoid intermittent test failures due to relying on hidden service
      introductory point creation within 5 seconds of real clock time.  The
      time limit for the test has been increased to 500 seconds, which may
      still result in intermittent failures (e.g. if the system doing the
      testing enters sleep/hibernation or experiences some other clock jump).
      However, this should elliminate test failures currently happening on
      developer and CI systems.  Fixes bug 25450; bugfix on 0.3.1.3-alpha.
