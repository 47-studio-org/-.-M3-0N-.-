  o Minor bugfixes (performance):
    - Reduce the number of circuits that can be opened at once during the
      circuit build timeout phase. This is done by increasing the idle timeout
      to 3 minutes, and lowering the maximum number of concurrent learning
      circuits to 10. Fixes bug 24769; bugfix on 0.3.1.1-alpha.
