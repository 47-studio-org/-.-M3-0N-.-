  o Major bugfixes (client, security):
    - Only use the ReachableAddresses option to restrict the first hop
      in a path. Previously, it would apply to every hop in the path,
      with a possible degredation in anonymity for anyone using an
      uncommon ReachableAddress setting. Fixes bug 19973; bugfix on
      0.2.8.2-alpha.
