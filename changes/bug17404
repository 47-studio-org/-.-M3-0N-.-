  o Major bugfixes (security, correctness):
    - Fix a programming error that could cause us to read 4 bytes before
      the beginning of an openssl string. This could be used to provoke
      a crash on systems with an unusual malloc implementation, or
      systems with unsual hardening installed. Fixes bug 17404; bugfix
      on 0.2.3.6-alpha.
