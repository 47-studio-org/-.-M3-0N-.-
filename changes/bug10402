  o Major bugfixes:
    - Do not allow OpenSSL engines to replace the PRNG, even when
      HardwareAccel is set. The only default builtin PRNG engine uses
      the Intel RDRAND instruction to replace the entire PRNG, and
      ignores all attempts to seed it with more entropy. That's
      cryptographically stupid: the right response to a new alleged
      entropy source is never to discard all previously used entropy
      sources. Fixes bug 10402; works around behavior introduced in
      OpenSSL 1.0.0. Diagnosis and investigation thanks to "coderman"
      and "rl1987".
