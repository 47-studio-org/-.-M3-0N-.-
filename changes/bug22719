  o Minor bugfixes (compression):
    - When spooling compressed data to an output buffer, don't try to
      spool more data when there is no more data to spool and we are
      not trying to flush the input. Previously, we would sometimes
      launch compression requests with nothing to do, which interferes
      with our 22672 checks. Fixes bug 22719; bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha.
