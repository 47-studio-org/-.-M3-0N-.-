  o Major bugfixes:

    - Send a CRLF at the end of each STATUS_* control-port event.  A
      change introduced in 0.2.3.16-alpha caused Tor to emit the CRLF
      in the middle of a STATUS_* event; among other things, this
      caused Vidalia to freeze.  Fixes bug 6094; bugfix on
      0.2.3.16-alpha.
